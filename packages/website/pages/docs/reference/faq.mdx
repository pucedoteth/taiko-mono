## What is Taiko?

Taiko is an Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup, scaling Ethereum by supporting all EVM opcodes in a layer-2 architecture that is decentralized, permissionless, and secure.

Does Taiko have a roadmap?

You can find our roadmap [Here](/images/roadmaps/taiko-roadmap.png)

## When will Taiko launch on mainnet?

TBA

## What is a ZK-EVM? 

A ZK-EVM is a privacy-focused version of the Ethereum Virtual Machine that incorporates zero-knowledge proofs to enable private and secure execution of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## What is a Type 1 ZK-EVM?

The different types of ZK-EVMs make tradeoffs between compatibility and proof generation cost. A Type 1 ZK-EVM prioritizes compatibility over proof generation cost.

Another term for Type 1 ZK-EVMs is “Ethereum-equivalent”. This term comes from the fact that Type 1 ZK-EVMs make no changes to the Ethereum architecture, whether it be the hash function, state trees, or gas costs. This equivalency allows us to reuse execution clients with minimal modification.

## Is Taiko open-source?

Yes, it allows users to access and modify the source code of the software, making it transparent and customizable.

## Can I ignore these logs from my node?

See [node troubleshooting](/docs/reference/node-troubleshooting) for a list of node logs that can be ignored and which are errors.

## Where can I find the deployed contract addresses?

See [contract addresses](/docs/reference/contract-addresses) for a list of deployed contract addresses.
